This drink traces it’s history to the Dark Ages of Cocktails, a time when ingredients were not really focused on in favor or making overly sweet drinks designed to get people wasted in nightclubs.

Well, I had a terrible experience with Southern Comfort as a kid, I have not taken a sip of it since then, and I wanted to see what would happen if I had some? Plus, I wanted to see what I thought of it’s flavors now as an adult. I’m constantly getting people to retry Gin after they’ve had bad experiences so I thought I’d put my money where my mouth is.","- 1 oz Vodka

97,Hurricane,https://www.theeducatedbarfly.com/hurricane/,"The Hurricane was said to have been first served at the World’s Fair in 1939. Not much in known about that drink other than it was made with Rum and served in a Hurricane Glass, and truth be told, I couldn’t find any actual evidence of that story being true. The most likely story is that it was created at Pat O’Brien’s Bar in New Orleans in the mid 1940’s just after the end of WWII. At the time Whiskey, Gin and Cognac were in short supply but we (as a country) had a surplus of Rum. Because of this supply problem it lead to spirits distributors to require a bar to order multiple cases of rum to get just one case of Whiskey, a practice many in the bar industry are familiar with if you’ve ever tried to get your hands on Pappy Van Winkle. Some reports have said that it was the Head Bartender Louis Culligan who actually created the drink’s recipe and to me that’s the more likely story. Although I have no proof that this is true, I will say that in all my years working behind a bar I have yet to meet an owner who has created any cocktails. More likely the owners tasked Culligan to come up with a drink to help use up their copious supply of rum. This is further supported by the fact that it was Culligan who first published the recipe in Cabaret Magazine in 1956. ","- 4 oz Jamaica Rum Dark Rum

It wasn’t until the late 1700’s in America that the tide began to change and the Julep was something that went from being a drink given for specific ailments to one that was drunk for fun. This early Juleps actually tended to resemble a Sling more than anything else but in 1802 is the first recorded evidence of Mint going into the Julep and even then it was referred to as a “Mint Sling.” According to David Wondrich there was a time when “people fought the good fight and called a Sling a Sling, but by the 1920’s it had become a Julep for good.” ","- 1.5 oz Brandy or VSOP Cognac

This can’t have been their creation though because Harry Craddock published a Millionaire #4 cocktail in the Savoy cocktail book in 1930. The presence of the number indicating that there were three previous versions as it was habit in the olden days to create a number for any variation on any cocktail to differentiate it from the original.

Baker Jr. was basically the David Wondrich of his day, most of his career was spent traveling the globe and writing about food and drink. He wrote three cocktail books which have become highly collectible for cocktail nerds like me, and many of the drinks have been resurrected (and sometimes reconstructed) during what we now call “The Cocktail Renaissance.” The Books are: The Gentleman’s Companion Vols. 1 & 2 and The South American Gentleman’s Companion.

The launched a competition to award $1000 to the bar that sold the most peach Schnapps and $100 to the bartender who did. Legend has it that a bartender named Ted Pizio who worked at a bar called Confetti in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. created the Sex On The Beach and won the competition. Although that is the most touted version there are those who say that it couldn’t be true because the actual original recipe of the Sex On The Beach was actually first recorded in a book called “American Bartenders School Guide To Drinks” published in 1981, so if it’s true it kinda refutes the Pizio story. I don’t know if anyone has a copy of this book or it’s merely conjecture but I’m thinking it’s the latter because if someone had the actual book this would be an easy one to get to the bottom of.

Essentially, my idea was to create a tiki drink driven by holiday flavors; not an entirely new idea, but one that sounded very appealing to me. I thought the amaretto could functionally take the role of the Curaçao in a Mai Tai while also providing its own almond-y flavor. I split the base with my aged Rhum Barbancourt in a nod to the aged agricole of a Mai Tai but in a subtler, oakier way. In addition, I added some falernum, allspice dram, bitters, and demerara syrup. I settled on lemon for my citrus but decided to add orange as well to spread out the heavy spice flavors a bit and add additional balancing sweetness. Finally, some over-the-top holiday-style garnishes to bring it home (with an extra nod to the Cobra’s Fang).

The lime leaf is a part of green curry, tamarind is a part of Pad Thai, and both of which often include roasted peanuts and/or peanut oil. It takes some familiar flavors and envisions it for a glass. I considered ‘Peanut Colada’ for a name, but it appears to be already in use for various recipes other cocktail. I chose ‘Viyada’ as a bit of my own Thai heritage that I think about from time to time as it’s the name my mother would have given me if I were born a girl, and I was named by my father instead.","- 1 oz Whiskey Skrewball peanut butter whiskey

249,Raton Laveur,https://www.theeducatedbarfly.com/raton-laveur/,"This cocktail came from a game where one person makes drinks for a small group of friends and everyone else tries to guess the ingredients. We sometimes add trick ingredients like apple cider vinegar, fish sauce, smoked salt, and hot sauce. The original version of the Raton Laveur was Skrewball, Mr. Black, and Sriracha. We thought the combination of Skrewball and spice was promising and started refining the recipe. First, we added an egg white to smooth out the mouth feel. We also swapped the sriracha for cayenne pepper to bring the heat into the roof of the mouth. We chose a sprinkle of cayenne and a coffee bean as the garnish to add some color to the foam and bring the spice of the drink onto the nose. Raton Laveur is French for racoon. The drink was named by a rogue wildlife biologist friend who was joking about going to catch racoons from the apartment trash can while tasting the first few versions of this drink. The Raton Laveur also has a contrast of dark colors from the coffee liqueur with white from the egg white foam, similar to the black and white of a racoon.","- 1.5 oz Skrewball Peanut Butter Whiskey

I was really drawn to it because it really seems like too many different flavors to possibly mix into one drink successfully. The flavors all sound like they go together, but the execution sounded difficult. Wanting to be able to make it on my own and without a response from the bar itself I attempted to recreate it based only on their vague list of ingredients below: Venezuelan & Guyanese Rum Malted Milk Coconut Banana Patent Coffee Pineapple Lime This spec was incredible difficult to decode since something like “Banana” or “Coconut” could mean countless different things. As I experimented with different ratios and different ingredients I eventually came upon a set of ingredients I liked. After 5 iterations I came up with this attempt and every adjustment I’ve attempted to make over the past two years has only made the drink worse.

Our last cocktail project, which we believe has been very successful, is a regional cocktail where the main ingredients come from our home state Schleswig-Holstein (the northernmost German state). The alcoholic basis of the cocktail is the so-called “Korn”, a German spirit made from wheat. Fresh “Zwetschgen”, a North German plum variety, is used for the taste. Together with orange and cinnamon notes, an extraordinary and extremely balanced combination is created. If we have aroused your interest, here is the recipe! We are looking forward to your feedback and your view on our “local hero“!Best regards from GermanyOle & Thilo","- 5 cl Oldesloer Korn

I don’t use single malts lightly in cocktails as one, they’re expensive, and two I have a great deal of respect for them so it’s really got to be banging.

334,The Poison Apple,https://www.theeducatedbarfly.com/the-poison-apple/,"James Brooks, Big fan of the show and a local bartender out of NC. I’m coming to you from “The Mark”; a bar located within the “Inn at Elon”, a five-star inn associated with one of the top business schools and one of the most beautiful campuses in North America. I came from more humble roots that don’t necessarily represent the university but I wanted something that took precedence of the area and wanted to represent its local flavor. The locally sourced apple brandy meshes perfectly with this bourbon smash and aids in its sweetness and smokiness. The cocktail presents itself as too much at first; both very tart and very sweet thus concealing its true abv content, this is less a bug and more a feature as it is served over ice in a pre-chilled rocks glass. As it leads you to go back for a “second bite” it dilutes itself becoming an unflowered delight in its true form; as well as a potent and dangerous abv mix! I must insist on demerara gum syrup and quality aged apple brandy for this, anything else will leave you with the unmistakable taste of a grape jolly rancher … an abomination I haven’t a name for yet. The acacia serves as the vector for both a mouthfeel that yields to its deception and helps in lengthening and delaying the apple crisp ending to this cocktail and the smokiness of the brandy pairs with the sweeter milder bourbon in painting a high-strung rip of acidity and flavor throughout the palate that is both delicate and very much hard-hitting. This is a cocktail that I have Halloween in particular in mind for and will be pushing for the bar to introduce in association with. A feature would sure help! I will happily send you a bottle of the suggested NC Apple Brandy! It’s a lovely product that fills a niece that I never knew I had in cocktail making. It shines in a select few. I hope this cocktail makes rounds this October! It has all the makings of the festive and iconic staple that I wish to establish here; with locally sourced ingredients that just fit in perfectly with the specs.

I needed to come up with an alternative that could be more like a Martini. It had to be something that could bridge the gap between shaken, sweet, purée drinkers and the stirred, boozy, bitter drinkers. Kevin Kos inspired me with his clarified pornstar martini episode. I bought myself some Pectinex, clarified some passion fruit purée and turn some of it into syrup. This was my starting point. One of my favourite flavour combinations is passion fruit and white chocolate, so I wash some cocoa butter in vodka. To give some balance to this I decided to keep the flavours of the pornstar martini. I gave Prosecco a foolproof role in the cocktail, instead of being shotted, sipped, or discarded by the guest. To add the bitterness of a martini, vanilla bitters were a no-brainer. After playing around with the ratios and Flavour Blaster bubbles, I put this on my menu at Girlfriend Bar in Clapham, London.

On their menu, I noticed they were serving Mai Tais, which immediately caught my attention as it is one of my favorite cocktails. However, I suspected they would not have the correct ingredients and indeed I was served something which did not have much reminiscence of a classical Mai Tai but instead reminded me of a lot of the spices used traditionally in baked goods around Christmastime (I am from Germany). However, it was surprisingly quite a pleasant drink and I came to the idea of creating a new version of the Mai Tai more suitable for the colder months and Christmastime. Back in Germany, I tinkered with several ingredients and eventually found a recipe in which all ingredients perfectly play off each other. The Licor 43 introduces vanilla in addition to the orange note. The Vanilla pairs well with the Orgeat and Gingerbread to contribute to the “holiday vibe”. The orange note combined with the slightly upped lime juice pair nicely with the fruity character of the Appleton 8 years. The Gingerbread syrup is the secret ingredient which gives the drink a whole different twist. The components in its flavor profile (molasses, cinnamon and ginger) also pair with the other ingredients -> molasses with the rum, cinnamon with the almond and vanilla flavors, and that slight hint of ginger adds even more complexity. I use the Gingerbread syrup from “Monin” for my cocktail recipe. I am not sure how prevalent the Monin Gingerbread syrup is in the US or if it is even the same that is sold in Europe, for $10 for a 750ml glass bottle. I have been a long time subscriber of your channel and really appreciate the work you guys have done.

If you think about it, it’s basically a deconstructed hot Toddy and definitely a derivation of Blackwood’s Hot Whiskey Punch. For much of its history spirits have been used as a medical cure for all sorts of ailments and during the Victorian era, Hot Whiskey was commonly used to clear up the common cold. And it does work to an extent. Apparently, whiskey is a pretty good decongestant, in the initial stages of intoxication (when you’re getting Tipsy) the alcohol in whiskey dilates your blood cells making it much easier for your mucus membranes to deal with the infection. The downside is that the more you drink (when alcohol reaches higher levels in your body) it’ll begin to constrict your blood vessels and raise your blood pressure exacerbating conditions like migraines. So maybe only have one.","- 2 oz Bourbon

So it’s no surprise that if you order a Frappe it will change bar to bar.

So Harry’s isn’t permanently closed! Yay! That fills my heart with joy!Harry’s Bar was opened in 1931 by Guiseppi Cipriani who in turn created the Bellini in the 1940’s. According to local legend an American by the name of Harry Pickering became a bar at the Europa Hotel where Cipriani was the bartender. Then all of a sudden just stopped coming. Some time later, Cipriani ran into Pickering and asked him why he stopped coming to the bar and Pickering replied that he was broke because upon finding out his drinking habits, his family had cut him off. Cipriani then lent Pickering 500 lire (about 8,000 dollars in today’s money) to help get him back on his feet. Two years later Pickering returned to Venice, found Cipriani and gave him 50,000 lire to repay him for his generosity. According to Harry’s website Pickering said “Mr. Cipriani thank you. Here’s The money, and to show you my appreciation for your generosity here’s 40,000 more enough to open a bar. We will call it Harry’s Bar.” Now that is a story almost as touching as the end of Ratatouille.","- 3 oz Prosecco

A drink already boasting seasonally appropriate flavors bolstered up by a little Applejack and Rum to make it that much more fall forward! This is one of my favorites. Also a little note, the original specs from Mr. Rice call for a few dashes of Angostura Bitters and I decided to go without, but if you’d like to add a little spice and bitter element to this drink, add ’em. Although I am a HUGE fan of bitters in just about anything, sometimes I feel a drink is just as good without that extra little kick. Anyway, this one is an easy one to shake up during the holiday so you can more easily deal with the inflows! Hope you guys enjoy it!","- 1 oz Rum Aged
